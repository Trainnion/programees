It covers areas such as logic and truth tables, set theory, functions and relations, combinatorics, graph theory, and proof techniques like induction and contradiction. The goal of the project is to provide students, educators, and enthusiasts with hands-on experience and visualizations to better understand the principles that form the backbone of computer science, cryptography, algorithms, and data structures. Whether used for academic study, self-learning, or teaching support, the project aims to make abstract concepts more concrete through examples, problem-solving activities, and code-based demonstrations.",
